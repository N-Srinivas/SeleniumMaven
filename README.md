# Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using Eclipse, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium 3, Appium and Page Object Model (POM)

## Test Subject
I've picked [https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login] as a test subject.

## Libraries and Frameworks
* Selenium - Web automation
* Appium - Mobile automation
* Maven - Build and package management
* TestNG - Test execution and Reporting

## Programming Language
I'm using [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version jdk1.8.0_111 and it works very well.
There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:
* It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.
* It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
* Because of the above two points it's possible to automate (testing) checking for iOS (Web and Native), Android (Web and Native) and Web platforms.
